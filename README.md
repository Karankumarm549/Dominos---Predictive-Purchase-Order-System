# Dominos-Predictive Purchase Order System
## DOMAIN:
- Food Service Industry
## INTRODUCTION:
- In this project, the task is to optimize the ingredient ordering process for Dominos by leveraging historical sales data and ingredient information. The goal is to accurately forecast future pizza sales and use these predictions to create an efficient purchase order system. By implementing this solution, Dominos can ensure sufficient stock of ingredients to meet customer demand, minimize waste due to overstocking, and prevent stockouts that disrupt operations. This project integrates predictive modeling with operational planning to enhance inventory management and streamline the purchasing process
